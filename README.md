## Artist Statement
Music is not just something we hear, it's something we feel. We created the BPM Time Machine to help this idea come to life and immerse listeners in a new type of experience. When you turn the dial, the screen shows the top song from a specific year (2015-2025), and a servo taps a drum to match the songâ€™s beats per minute (BPM). This lets you see how music styles have changed over the years and actually feel the rhythm and the evolution of music through the years. 
The intended audience of this project is music lovers. Given a beat, this music-loving audience can reflect on the hit songs since 2015. 
You can use this project in schools to teach students about beats or in museums as a fun way to learn about music history. It could also be placed at a recording studio to showcase their top artists or as an interactive art installation. The BPM Time Machine is just the beginning; this idea can grow to include other automatic instruments, creating a robotic band that plays different songs. This way, you can experience music in a new and exciting way.
